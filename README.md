Sublime Syntax definition for [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to colorize command `--help` messages.

It provides just enough color to help find your way around a help message.

## Installation

This syntax is included with `bat` since version 0.21.0.

If you have an older version of `bat`, you can add [this](./syntaxes/cmd-help.sublime-syntax) as a [custom syntax](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#adding-new-syntaxes--language-definitions).

Check it works properly by running `mv --help | bat -plhelp`

## Configuration

### Streamline it

You may want to put an alias plus a function around this in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`/`.*rc`:

```sh
alias bathelp='bat --plain --language=cmd-help'
help() (
    set -o pipefail
    "$@" --help 2>&1 | bathelp
)
```

Then you can do `help git`. Or `help git commit`.

Depending on the command, `help()` will even handle alternative help options, e.g.: `help bat -h`.

If `help()` doesn't work with a command's alternative help option, you can still do `CMD --help-option | bathelp`.

### `bat` theme support

The syntax works nicely with most `bat` themes. In some cases, even better than with the default Monokai theme (used in the above example). You can find examples of working themes [here](https://github.com/victor-gp/cmd-help-sublime-syntax/tree/demo/docs/examples/theme).

To use a different theme, just append `--theme=<your preferred theme>` to your `bat` commands. More info [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#highlighting-theme).

You may also want to experiment with setting `--italic-text=always`. A few themes use italics on some elements, including Monokai.
